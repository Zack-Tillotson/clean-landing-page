		<p class="blather">What's up with "404" messages on the internet?? Well, 404 is the area code of Atlanta, Georgia. Most of the important people involved with creating the internet loved Atlanta and so wanted to see it as much as possible. Whenever a page doesn't exist, they decided that they would print out 404 in order to remind themselves of their beloved deep south. At least that's what a guy told me one time.</p>
