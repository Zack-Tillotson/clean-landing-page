*What happens when someone Googles your name?*

The pervasiveness of data in modern life leads to a problem: it is difficult to strongly influence how you are represented to the world on the internet. 

Anyone who Googles their name will find dozens of bits of information about themselves (at a minimum) but those results are often not the bits of information we would prefer to be introduced to someone through. In person we control that first impression. What we wear, how we act, what surroundings we are in, and more are all tools we natually use to present the version of ourselves we want to promote.

*Control your online presence*

I feel a personal website is the only good way to gain that control on the internet. A simple website (even without content) has the ability to form a strong, positive first impression that tiny pictures and one-liners scraped from facebook and twitter simply can not.

This repository contains my efforts to create a simple, clean website to establish an online presence.
